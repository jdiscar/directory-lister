This is a simple program I made back in 2008 that I still (occasionally) use today. It's a really simple app for printing out a directory tree, made in Visual Studio 2005 using CSharp. The GUI makes it very easy to use with a fair amount of customization.

The code itself is old and nothing special, but it might be useful as a very simple example of a CSharp Windows Desktop Application. They're really easy to make with Visual Studio.
